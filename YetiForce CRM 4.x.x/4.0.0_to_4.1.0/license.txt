The update time might be longer depending on the server speed and amount of data in the system. 
The update package corrects missing elements in permissions that's why we recommend checking permissions configuration.
The update overwrites all configuration files in the config directory, we recommend creating a backup copy of the files, and introduce your changes after the update.
Log files should be checked after update.
